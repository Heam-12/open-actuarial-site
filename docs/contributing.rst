Discussion and Contributing
===========================

Contributing to this wiki
-------------------------

To add to this wiki either:

#. Add an 'issue' explaining your suggestion to the `Issue Tracker <https://github.com/open-actuarial/open-actuarial-site/issues>`_ of the site's repository on GitHub. Someone else can then pick up the suggestion and incorporate it into the site. (very simple to do, good for anyone not yet comfortable with GitHub or Sphinx)
#. `Edit the site <editing_the_site_>`_ yourself by submitting a pull-request (requires knowledge of GitHub and Sphinx but significantly reduces the workload for the Core Team)


.. _editing_the_site:

Editing the site
----------------

This site follows the standard steps for contributing to a GitHub based open-source project:

#. Fork the site's `repository <https://github.com/open-actuarial/open-actuarial-site>`_ to your personal GitHub account.
#. Clone your fork to your local machine
#. Create a new branch for your suggestion
#. Make the changes by adding new pages to the wiki (as rst or md files), editing existing ones or a combination of both
#. Test that the change has the desired effect by rebuilding the wiki using Make HTML
#. Commit the change to the feature branch
#. Push the changes to your forked GitHub repository
#. Submit a pull request on main repository
#. The change will be reviewed by the Core Team - if revisions are requested further commits may be required
#. Pull request is accepted or rejected
