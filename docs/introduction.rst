Introduction
============

Open Actuarial is a group for the promotion of open approaches to actuarial problems.

This organisation aims to:

- Identify the main areas where open tools can benefit actuarial analyses
- Support and publicise existing open tools that can help actuarial analysis
- Aid in the development of new tools, especially where gaps in the available toolset exist
- Educate the actuarial community on the availability, benefits and occasional downsides of open tools

Areas for focus
---------------
Below are some of the areas where the actuarial community can benefit from open tools:

Basic core statistical functions and classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- core probabilistic functions ala Actuar including blended distributions e.g. mixed exponential, mixed pareto, etc
- curve fitting
- dependency modelling and parameterisation
- data manipulation and charting tools

Domain specific data dictionaries and datasets (real and dummy)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Standardised data dictionaries/glossaries
- Tools for the transformation of data from formats typically used in administration systems to those suitable for analysis
- Real datasets
- Dummy datasets (useful where either real data is unavailable for commercial reasons and for ensuring that actuarial analyses work appropriately)

Statistical analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- tools for generalised linear regression, mixed models, survival analysis, bayesian analysis, machine learning

Reporting tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Web based, pdf-able reports (to improve on Excel based reporting)
- web apps
- Notebooks
- Web based presentations

Development and production environments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Applying DevOps principles to Actuarial work:

- Collaboration and Version control (Git, TFS, Mecurical, SVN)
- Testing (unit tests, speed tests, test-driven development)
- Continuous integration
- Push button deployments
- Development, Testing and Production environments (virtualisation and containers)
- 'Big Data' architectures

Domain specific tools and models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- General Insurance/Property & Casualty
- Life Insurance
- Investments
